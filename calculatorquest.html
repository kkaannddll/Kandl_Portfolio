      <div class="greyback">
        <h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>
        <p>I compared two large based cloud storage companies that have a large market share (Dropbox and Googledrive) and one a small slice of the market (Box). I found that all functioned similary and offered the upload and downloading of any
          type
          of
          file whether it be texts, photos, or video files. Each had a free version open to all users with between 5-10gb of memory and each had a paid subscription to increase total available gigabites to its users. With so many options in
          uploading
          files, I did not find cloud-based specilization. I wanted to investigate this further and look at if people uploaded soundfiles regularly to their cloud-based drives.</p>

      <h6>Personas</h6>
      <img class="personas" alt="Jerry Persona" src="images/aaeena/aaeenaPersonas.png" />
      <p>Three users with distinct roles were interviewed to gather what their wants, needs, goals, motivations, and frustrations regarding emotions and cloud storage.</p>
    </div>

    <!--user stories section-->
    <div>
      <h6>User Stories</h6>
      <p class="greyBoxes">Automatically record and upload conversations.</p>
      <p class="greyBoxes">Assign emotions to phrases based on tonal inflections.</p>
      <p class="greyBoxes">Anonymous content sharing with other users.</p>
      <p class="greyBoxes">View unbroken complete spoken history.</p>
    </div>

    <!--user flows section-->
    <div>
      <h6>User Flows</h6>
      <p>Simplicity is what the user demands. An intuitive Dashboard where the most pertinent user information would be found. History where the user to view all the content. Search and Related content so the user sees they are not alone. And most
        importantly a mood graph for easy self realization in emotional habit forming.</p>
      <img class="aaeenaimg" alt="Aaeena User Flow" src="images/aaeena/AaeenaUserFlows.jpg" />
      <p>The main goal is accessability for all, thus the user flows are simple and intuitive. The app is designed to do one thing really well. I want this software to transcende age, culture, and socio-economic status. The simpler, the better.</p>

    <!--moodboard section-->
    <div>
      <h6>Moodboard</h6>
      <p>Both Boris and I were both feeling the vibe and simplicity early video games had to offer.</p>
      <img class="aaeenaimg" alt="Calculator Quest Moodboard" src="images/cq/CQMood.png" />
    </div>


    <!--branding section-->
    <div class="greyback">
      <h6>Branding</h6>
      <p>Aaeena is unbiased like a mirror, what you see is what you get. What you said is what you will hear. I want the product to be low stress and calming to use. Everyone has their own unique way to find inner peace, however I feel nature is
        the
        single item everyone can relate to. I want this app to be accessable to all, therefore I strived to create an environment tied to the Earths natural beauty. </p>

      <h6>Logo Design</h6>
      <img class="aaeenaimg" alt="Aaeena Logo Vertical" src="images/aaeena/aaeenalogodesigns.png" />
    </div>
    <p>The logo is representative of a mirror. Two perfect reflections of each other. I wanted something that really drove home the idea of perfect reflection. What you give aaeena will be perfectly reflected back at you. Green was the appropriate
      color choice as it is the ultimate symbolic color for nature and life.</p>


    <!--logo evolution-->
    <div>
      <h6>Logo Evolution</h6>
      <img class="aaeenaimg" alt="Logo Evolution Process" src="images/cq/CQLogoIdea1.png"/>

      <p>My first instict was to draw inspiration from the genisis of computer gaming.
        I presented my idea to Boris and he gave me his feedback and suggested something a decade
        or two more modern than the look above.  We met in person to discuss his vision and decided
       on gaming from our own late 80's early 90's computer vibe. </p>

        <p>blah blah blah.  We were seeking inspiration in easy to useitems that influenced our childhood...<p/>

    <!--Design Progession-->
    <div>
      <h6>Design Progression</h6>
      <p>Boris instantly liked the homescreen layout and found not much room in improvement for the layout
      and gave me the go-ahead.</p>
      <img class="aaeenaimg" alt="Grey Scale Mockup" src="images/cq/CQOriginal.png" />

      <img class="aaeenaimg" alt="First Draft with Color" src="images/cq/CQFirstDraft.png" />

      <p>Looks cool!  I like the layout of the front screen, think it work well. I dig the color scheme,
        but I also feel like it would feel sorta harsh/alienating for anyone who doesn't get the
        nostalgia of it?  I feel a bit like I'm about to get shot with a laser haha. I've definitely been
        going for more 'serene' feeling color schemes now that I think about it.. math is sorta scary."
        I agreed with his views and he sent an color pallet he thought was appropriate and I asked him
        what his most influential childhood game was.</p>

    <!--What I learned-->
    <div>
      <h6>What I learned</h6>

      <p>Simplicity Works! It is easy to stary from the origional proposed groundwork, but pays off to be methodical and not stray too far. It was super interesting getting other peoples feedback and understanding how different perspectives
        come
        into play. People, other than me, seem to prefer less contrast and brighter colors. I always wondered why webpages used white backgrounds and dark text. I assumed it was a carry over from books, but aparently it is peoples true
        preference.
